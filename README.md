Face Detection using OpenCV

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascades. The program captures video from a webcam, detects faces in each frame, and draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection using OpenCV.

Uses Haar Cascade Classifier for fast and efficient face detection.

Works with live webcam feed.

Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

Press 'q' to exit the application.

🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository

git clone (https://github.com/juniorat24/Computer-Vision-Project)
cd face-detection-opencv

2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

pip install opencv-python numpy

🔍 How to Run the Project

Run the script using Python:

python face_detection.py

📜 Code Explanation

Loads a pre-trained Haar Cascade face detection model.

Captures frames from a webcam.

Converts each frame to grayscale.

Detects faces and draws bounding boxes.

Displays the output in real-time.

Press 'q' to close the application.

🖼️ Example Output



📌 Future Improvements

Implement deep learning-based face detection using ResNet SSD.

Add face recognition using OpenCV and dlib.

Save detected faces as image files.
